Unable to turn down a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy their dream house for nothing, Keira and Brian Woods move into a vast, lavish, fully-furnished Irish manor in the city's suburbs. As their sulky teenage daughter Ellie and her younger brother Steven wander around the cold rooms of their eerily-vacant new home, an intriguing wind-up gramophone in the living room suddenly catches their attention. And, without a doubt, there must be more treasures hidden in plain sight. But who knows what lies behind the kids' peculiar behaviour? What dark, hair-raising wonders lurk in the cellar?
