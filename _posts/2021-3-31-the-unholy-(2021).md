After a supposed visitation from the Virgin Mary, young hearing-impaired girl Alice is inexplicably able to hear and speak--and heal the sick. As word spreads and people from near and far flock to witness her miracles, a disgraced journalist hoping to revive his career visits her small New England town to investigate. When terrifying events begin to happen all around, he starts to question if these phenomena are the works of the Virgin Mary or something much more sinister.
