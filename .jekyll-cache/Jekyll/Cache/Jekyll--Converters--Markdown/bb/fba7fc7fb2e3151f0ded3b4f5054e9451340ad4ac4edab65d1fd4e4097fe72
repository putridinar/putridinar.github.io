I"<p>Street-smart Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor â€œSullyâ€ Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to recover a fortune amassed by Ferdinand Magellan and lost 500 years ago by the House of Moncada. What starts as a heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the clues and solve one of the worldâ€™s oldest mysteries, they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nateâ€™s long-lost brotherâ€¦but only if they can learn to work together.</p>
